MEWES (MEWsical Exercise Selector) generates exercises for music students using Constraint Satisfaction Programming.  It is built on top of [Strasheela](http://strasheela.sourceforge.net/strasheela/doc/index.html).  This project creates [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org) files; separate software will be required to display and grade student work.

These exercises are currently being used in:
  * [MEWER](http://code.google.com/p/mewer): an online game which uses the rhythmic exercises, while
  * [MEAWS](http://code.google.com/p/meaws): is a C++ game which uses rhythm and intonation exercises.

Currently there are two types of exercises:
  * Basic rhythms (4/4 time, up to sixteenth notes, eighth note triplets, and double-dotted rhythms)
  * Basic violin intonation (1st and 3rd positions)
